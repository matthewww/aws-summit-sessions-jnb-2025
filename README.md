# aws-summit-sessions-jnb-2025



## Session Types

### Keynotes

* Large, main-stage presentations.
* Delivered by AWS executives, senior engineers, or high-profile customers.
* Cover **major announcements, strategic directions, customer success stories**, and big-picture trends.
* Usually open to all attendees and set the tone for the event.

### Breakout Sessions

* The most common format, usually **45–60 minutes**.
* Deep dives into specific AWS services, architectures, or use cases.
* Grouped by tracks (e.g., AI/ML, serverless, security, migration, data & analytics).
* Can be **introductory (Level 100)**, intermediate (200), advanced (300), or expert (400).

### Workshops

* Hands-on sessions, often **2–3 hours long**.
* Attendees work in teams with guidance from AWS instructors.
* Cover **practical scenarios** like building serverless apps, deploying ML models, or securing workloads.
* Require you to bring your own laptop and AWS account.

### Chalk Talks

* Whiteboard-driven technical discussions.
* Around 45–60 minutes, with an AWS expert leading but **audience-driven Q\&A** shaping the flow.
* Great for **architectural discussions** or clarifying best practices.
* Less slide-heavy, more **dialogue and sketching**.

### Lightning Talks

* Short, **20–30 minute presentations**.
* Focused on **specific topics or quick insights**.
* Often scheduled in expo/demo areas or smaller stages.
* Good for quick overviews without deep technical depth.

### Interactive Training

* Guided, self-paced labs you can do during the summit.
* Walkthroughs on AWS services (like building with Lambda, RDS, or SageMaker).
* Often powered by AWS-provided temporary accounts.
* More structured than workshops, less open-ended.
